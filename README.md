# Heart Rate Monitor

An Arduino-based heart rate monitoring system that provides real-time BPM readings with visual feedback and health advisories.

## Features

- **Real-time Heart Rate Detection**: Accurate BPM measurement using analog pulse sensor
- **OLED Display**: Clear visualization of heart rate data on 128x64 OLED screen
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated heart icon that beats in sync with detected pulse
- **Health Advisory**: Automatic health status assessment based on heart rate ranges
- **Signal Processing**: Built-in noise filtering and smoothing for reliable readings
- **Object Detection**: Automatic detection when finger is placed on sensor

## Hardware Components

- Arduino (Uno/Nano)
- Pulse sensor (analog)
- SSD1306 OLED Display (128x64)
- LED indicator
- Connecting wires and breadboard

## Quick Start

1. Upload `bpm_monitor.ino` to your Arduino
2. Connect the hardware as per the circuit diagram
3. Place your finger on the pulse sensor
4. View real-time heart rate on the OLED display
